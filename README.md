# Another rewrite of simplytranslate in Go
Basically, simplytranslate has been dead for a while and I want to remake it, but with some QoL improvements ofc :)

I'm initially focusing on the api/engines part, but eventually ill get around to setting up the gofiber thing. I plan on making it a combined cli+webui
