# Mozhi
Mozhi (spelt moá¸»i) is an alternative-frontend for many translation engines.

It was initially made as a maintained fork/rewrite of [simplytranslate](https://codeberg.org/SimpleWeb/SimplyTranslate-Web), but has grown to have a lot more features as well!

I'm initially focusing on the api and engines, but eventually Mozhi will have a functioning CLI and webapp.

## Supported Engines:
- Google
- Reverso
- DeepL
- LibreTranslate
- Yandex
- IBM Watson
- MyMemory
- DuckDuckGo (almost 1-1 with Bing Translate)

## Installation
Just `go build` and you're done :D

## Features
- An all mode where the responses of all supported engines will be shown.
- Autodetect which will show the language that was detected
- Tesseract based image recognition (it isn't that good to be fair but it works nontheless)
- Text-To-Speech for multiple engines
- A good API (subjective :P)
- All the stuff you expect from a translation utility :)

## Etymology
Mozhi is the word in Tamil for language. Simple as that :P
